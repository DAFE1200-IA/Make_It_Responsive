    <h1>What is an inovation camp?</h1>

    <p>
An innovation camp is an opportunity to explore new ideas to real problems, teach you to think outside of the box and get a breath of fresh air to your issues.
    </p>
    <p>
As the client that has the problem we present to the participants,  it gives you a unique opportunity to get fresh eyes on a problem you are encountering, across multiple disseplinces. (Dependant on who participates.) We host the event and find people to participate, who we then guide through the process. At the end of the camp either all the groups, or a selected few (after a review of the rapports) presents the ideas to you for potential further development.
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="schedule.html">Want to participate?</a>
    </p>
    <p>
As a participant you can learn valuable skills that help you think outside the box. We will put you into groups, and present a problem from the client. You will be guided through the process of coming up with innovative solutions, and encouraged to think outside the box. No previous experience is needed, all you need is an open mind and motivations to learn about new things.
